# PROJECT 12: WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

In this project, I'm working on creating the back end of my What to Wear application that I've been working on in the past few sprints. I'm buidling this DB from the ground up and the technologies that I'm using are express, mongoDB, Postman for API/DB connectivity testing. In this project, I've created several differet routes in order for my DB to connect to the different request I'm making through the application. I've set up controllers to handle different GET, PUT, DELETE, POST requests to ultimately apply changes to the front end of the application. Both the user section & clothing item section will be able to be updated throught the backend of this project

## Error Handling

I've implemented a variety of different error message handlers to ensure that any errors/fails in the DB can be easily identifiable and resolved. I've created several constants as opposed to hardcoding error messages to prevrent any hardcoded error issues. I've implemented orFail functions as well to smoothen out the error finding process as well.
